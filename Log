#Log of the progress:
#The first part was to handle the download of the files. This was done within the Rackham computer. It was pretty straight forward. This was done within a tmux session: "tmux new-session -s download".

#The second part was to transfer the files from Rackham into Bianca.
#This was done through a combination of tmux, ssh, stfp, and put. Where first one created a tmux session "tmux new-session -s transfer", then one logged into the "ssh-Rackham" and moved to the desired directory containing all the sra files. After that one (while inside ssh-Rackham) connected to bianca through stfp (stfp-Bianca). Once inside, one moved to the desired directory one wants the file, within Bianca, and then one simply used "put *" to transfer all the files into Bianca.
#However, do note that 2 files ERS1066765 and ERS1066773 were not downloaded in Rackham due to limit of space and had to be downloaded afterwards.

#The third part was to convert the .sra files into .fastq format. This was done through the sratool fasterq-dump. First one tried it within rackham with the 2 files that had to be downloaded in a second batch, ERS1066773 and ER1066765. It was simply done within a tmux session "tmux new -s conversion" while within Rackham and then simply insert the modules "module load bioinfo-tools sratools" and then convert it "fasterq-dump ERS1066765" for the first one. Sample ERS1066773 will be converted later. Once the conversion for ERS1066765 had been completed. It gave 2 fastq files, each 383 GB in size. They were then compressed using the tar command "tar -czvf ERS1066765.tar.gz ERS1066765.sra_1.fastq ERS1066765.sra_2.fastq"
